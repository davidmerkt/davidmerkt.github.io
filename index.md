# About

As long as I can remember I have been fascinated by all things technical. As a 
child I would take apart any electronic or mechanical objects that I could get 
my hands on and figure out how they worked. Now I create the highest quality 
software solutions, with an emphasis on both providing an excellent user 
experience as well as ensuring the highest level of security.

Living in New England, I am an avid enthusiast of outdoor sports - participating
 in biking, running, and hiking adventures.

I give back in a variety of ways. Throughout the year I volunteer at various 
local running events, including acting as Aid Station Captain at the Vermont 100
 Endurance Race. I am also the Race Director of the NipMuck Trail Marathon. I 
perform webmaster duties for my running club, the Shenipsit Striders.
